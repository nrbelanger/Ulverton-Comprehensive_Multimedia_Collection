Web editing
- Quick edits: Press `.` on the repo page to open github.dev.
- Full cloud dev: Use GitHub Codespaces (if available).

Workflow
- Work on feature branches and open pull requests to `main`.
- Use Issues / Projects to track tasks and milestones.
- Consider enabling GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages) to host your site from `main` or `gh-pages`.

Additions you may want next
- A `docs/` or `public/` folder for site assets
- CSS framework or build tool (npm + parcel/webpack/eleventy) if you want a more complex pipeline
- Accessibility, linting (htmlhint), and CI for previews

If you want, I can create a branch and add the starter files above, open a PR, or walk you through opening a Codespace — which would you prefer?
